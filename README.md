# PointCrawler

a demo on "crawling" to set points. 

The Crawl() method attempts to increment a float by 0.1f in a direction (either positve or negative), if the difference is lower then the original value,
it will return the new value. 

If the orignal value and destination values are the same; it returns 0.0f.
